      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>ORCID provides a digital persistent identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. Using an ORCID allows your manuscripts, grants, and other scholarship to be more discoverable and integrated within larger research networks.</p>
